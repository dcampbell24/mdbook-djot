# Demo Book

This is a simple demo book, which is intended to be used for verifying and validating style changes in mdBook.
This contains dummy examples of various djot elements and code languages, so that one can check changes made in mdBook styles.

This rough outline is :

: individual

    contains basic djot elements such as headings, paragraphs, links etc.

: languages

    contains a `hello world` in each of supported language to see changes in syntax highlighting

: rust

    contains language examples specific to rust, such as play pen, runnable examples etc.

: djot specific inline

    contains djot specific items that are inline.

This is more for checking and fixing style, rather than verifying that correct code is generated for given djot, that is better handled in tests.
